# jarvis-plugin-speech-deepspeech

This plugin is a draft. 

It requires deepspeech to be installer on the same raspberry as the module. 
The plugin interacts with it by executing a python script to stream the microphone and read the output
to find the recognized sentences.

But since the available french model is not really accurate, this plugin has not been fully developped.
